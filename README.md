Slides for my Yesod talk at the Hamburg Haskell User Group.

It's about Yesod 1.0.5. You can view it on it's [GitHub page](http://janahrens.github.com/hug_hh-yesod_talk).

If you want to build this talk yourself, please don't forget to
initialize the submodules: `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.
